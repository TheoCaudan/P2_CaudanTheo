School Project (Front-End, web page integration)

Hi,
I am a student at Openclassrooms, this project is the second one in order to validate the degree in the Front-End path of that school.

The objectives here are :

- Know how to build a webpage from scratch with only HTML and CSS.
- Being able to do it alone or at least find the solutions by ourselves with the help of nothing but internet and the school community (more or less all ressources in the end).
- All has to be checked on the W3C Markup Validation Service.

In order to make a working webpage I will :

- Create a HTML file to integrate a webpage for a booking website (index.html)
- Stylize it, thanks to a pure CSS file (style.css)
- Adding media queries to make it a responsive webpage

Once the project uploaded on the school repository I'll have to pass a defense, explaining what I did and why (more or less).

I will update this readme as things progress...

Thank you for reading me.
